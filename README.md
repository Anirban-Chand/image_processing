# image_processing
In this project, I tried to make a grayscale image(.pgm format) a binary image(.pgm format, you can convert it easily into .pbm format). This process is called 'Binarization'. This image processing code is totally written in C language without using any type of 'image libraries' e.g - 'stb_image'. We need 2 files to process an image. Here you have to put your input image file (.pgm format) --> final output image file (.pbm format). 

Follow the Steps to Run the Program and Get Desired Output::
1. Run the Command Prompt in the folder where you have stored your code. Or you can simply run CMD and change the file directory to the destination folder.
2. Run the given command - "gcc -o bin bin.c". It'll create the executable file for your C program.
3. Run the given command - "bin.exe input_filename.pgm output_filename.pbm". You're done.
4. Congratulations, you have just used my code and run it to Binarize a grayscale image successfully.
