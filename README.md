# image_processing
In this project I tried to make grayscale image(.pgm format) a binary image(.pgm format, you can convert it easily into .pbm format). This process is called 'Binarization'. This image processing code is totally written in C language without using any type of 'image libraries' e.g - 'stb_image'. We need 3 files to process an image. Here you have to put your input image file (.pgm format) --> any temporary output image file (e.g - out.pgm) --> final output image file (.pgm format).
